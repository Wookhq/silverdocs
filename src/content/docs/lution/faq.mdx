### Does Bloxstrap FFlags work on Lution?
Bloxstrap FFlags **should work on Lution (Sober)** as long as the FFlag isn’t exclusive to Windows. Some FFlags are Windows-only and won’t be compatible with Android/Linux.

***

### Will Lution work on Linux Mint?
Yes. Lution **works on Linux Mint** as long as you have **Python** installed and follow the [official setup guide](/lution/installation/).  
It’s built to be compatible with most Linux distributions.

***

### Is Lution a fork of Bloxstrap/Fishstrap?
**No.** Lution is written entirely from scratch. While projects like Bloxstrap and Fishstrap served as inspiration, Lution is its own independent project.

***

### Is Lution bannable?
**No.**  
Lution is not bannable because it doesn’t interfere with the Sober client directly. It only modifies textures and FFlags, which are safe to use.

***

### What if my Roblox account gets stolen while using Lution?
Lution is an **open-source project**, meaning the source code is public and reviewable by anyone.  
This transparency allows the community to audit the code for security. While caution is always recommended when using third-party tools, the open-source nature of Lution provides an extra layer of trust.  
Additionally, Lution is designed exclusively for Linux.

***

### I uninstalled Lution, but I still see “Lution with Sober”
You also need to manually remove the desktop entry:  
```bash
rm ~/.local/share/applications/Lution.desktop
````
