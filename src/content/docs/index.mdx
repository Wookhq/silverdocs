## What is Silverr? üêß


Silverr is a **bootstrapper** designed specifically for the **Sober runtime**, which allows you to run Roblox on Linux. While Sober handles the low-level compatibility, Silverr provides the high-level tools you need to manage your gaming experience. Just like bootstrappers for Windows (Bloxstrap, Fishstrap... etc), Silverr gives you more control, all built with Python for a native Linux feel.
