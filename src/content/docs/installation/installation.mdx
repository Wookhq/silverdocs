## Quick Install Options ðŸš€

If you don't want to build Silverr from source, use one of the options below.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="AppImage (Universal)">
This is the recommended method for most Linux distributions.

### 1. AppImage (Universal Linux)

An AppImage is a single file that bundles the application and all its dependencies, allowing it to run on most modern Linux systems without system-wide installation.

<Steps>

1.  **Download the AppImage**
    Grab the latest stable build from our GitHub Actions workflow page:
    [**Download Latest Builds**](https://github.com/Wookhq/silverr/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

    > **Note:** You may need to be logged into GitHub to access these artifact downloads.

2.  **Make it Executable**
    Navigate to where you downloaded the file (e.g., `~/Downloads`) and grant it execution permission.

    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/Downloads/silverr-*.AppImage
    ```

3.  **Run the Application**
    Execute the file to start Silverr. You can also move it to a standard location like `~/Applications` for easier access.

    ```bash
    ~/Downloads/silverr-*.AppImage
    ```

</Steps>
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Arch Linux (AUR)">

### 2. Arch Linux and Derivatives (AUR)

Silverr is available in the Arch User Repository (AUR) as a Git package. We recommend using a modern AUR helper for installation.

<Steps>

1.  **Install with an AUR Helper**
    Use your preferred AUR helper (e.g., `yay`, `paru`) to fetch and build the package from source.

    ```bash
    # Using yay
    yay -S rblx-silver-git
    
    # Alternatively, using paru
    # paru -S rblx-silver-git
    ```

2.  **Launch the Application**
    Once installed, the package provides a desktop entry. You can launch Silverr from your application menu or the terminal.

    ```bash
    rblx-silver-git
    ```
    > **Note:** The package name is typically based on the project and suffix (`-git` for AUR source), but the launch command is usually the simpler binary name.

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the AppImage, ensure your FUSE libraries are up-to-date. For AUR issues, check the package comments on the official AUR page for `rblx-silver-git`.
