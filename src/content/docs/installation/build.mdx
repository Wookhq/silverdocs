## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system.

<Steps>

1.  **Node.js (Latest LTS):**
    The project requires a recent version of Node.js. We recommend using the **latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version**.
    You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

2.  **Git:**
    You'll need Git installed to clone the project repository.
    You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Setup and Build Guide üöÄ

Follow these steps to get a local copy of **Silverr** up and running.

<Steps>

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Use Git to clone the project to your local machine and navigate into the directory.

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Wookhq/silverr.git](https://github.com/Wookhq/silverr.git)
    cd silverr
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all required Node.js packages for the project.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the Project**
    The build process involves compiling the frontend assets and preparing the final application distribution files.

    * To compile the **frontend assets** (e.g., for development):
        ```bash
        npm run build # Creates production-ready frontend assets.
        ```
    * To create the **final application distribution** (includes both frontend and backend preparation):
        ```bash
        npm run dist  # Packages the entire application for deployment or distribution.
        ```
        > **Note:** The `npm run dist` command usually runs `npm run build` as part of its process, but running `npm run build` separately can be useful for debugging the frontend.

</Steps>
