**Lution** is a Python-powered bootstrapper for [Sober](https://github.com/Vinegarhq/Sober), the custom Roblox client for Linux. Think of it as a Linux-native version of **Bloxstrap** — built for users who want a smoother, more customizable experience. And yes, it works with your existing Bloxstrap mods.

### **Core Features**

* ⚡ **Lightweight & Simple** – Written in Python, with zero bloat.
* 🛠️ **Mod Support** – Fully compatible with Bloxstrap mods.
* 🛒 **Built-in Mod Marketplace** – Browse and install mods easily.
* ✨ **Font Customization** – Change Roblox fonts in just a few clicks.
* 🚩 **Preset FFlags** – Pre-configured FFlags, similar to Bloxstrap.
* 👥 **Player Logging (Join, Leave, Chat)** – Beta feature inspired by Fishstrap.
