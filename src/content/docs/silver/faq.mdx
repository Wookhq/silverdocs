### Does Bloxstrap FFlags work on Lution?
Bloxstrap FFlags **should work on Lution (Sober)** as long as the FFlag isn’t exclusive to Windows. Some FFlags are Windows-only and won’t be compatible with Android/Linux.

***

### Will Silver work on Linux Mint?
Yes. Silver **works on Linux Mint**.  
It’s built to be compatible with most Linux distributions.

***

### Is Silver a fork of Bloxstrap/Fishstrap/Lution?
**No.** Silver is written entirely from scratch. While projects like Bloxstrap, Fishstrap, Lution served as inspiration, Silver is its own independent project.

***

### Is Silver bannable?
**No.**  
Silver is not bannable because it doesn’t interfere with the Sober client directly. It only modifies textures and FFlags, which are safe to use.

***

### spyware detected; go kys
Silver is an **open-source project**, meaning the source code is public and reviewable by anyone.  
This transparency allows the community to audit the code for security. While caution is always recommended when using third-party tools, the open-source nature of Lution provides an extra layer of trust.

### What will happen to Lution?
You can still use it but its will not be actively maintain by Chip, instead its will be maintain by @gio_guy
